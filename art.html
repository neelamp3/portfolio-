But it was a fun experience to do a art exchange with someone who is as good or if not better than me at art. </p>

        <p class="description">This picture is of me. My teacher Ms Cruz told me that I could design the school so I drew me because I was thinking they could make an individual sweater for every senior student in the school. but they are doing general sweaters for all of the senior students. So I will keep this to make my own senior sweater. </p>
